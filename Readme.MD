# Assignment: Create a Personal Portfolio Website

## Description:

Your task is to create a personal portfolio website that showcases your skills, projects, and information about yourself. The website should have multiple pages and incorporate HTML and CSS to create a visually appealing and interactive user experience.

## Requirements:

1. **Home Page:** Create a home page that introduces yourself and provides an overview of your portfolio. Include a brief description about yourself and your areas of expertise.
2. **Skills Page:** Create a page that highlights your skills. Organize the skills into different categories and use CSS (colors only) to style them accordingly. Use appropriate colors to make the page visually appealing.
3. **Projects Page:** Create a page that showcases your projects. Include at least three projects with a brief description, images, and links to more information if available. Use CSS (colors only) to style the project details and layout.
4. **Contact Page:** Create a contact page that includes a contact form or your contact information (email, phone number, etc.). Use CSS (colors only) to style the contact form or information section. You can also embed a link to your address.
5. **Navigation:** Include a navigation menu or a navigation bar that allows users to easily navigate between the different pages of your portfolio website.
6. **Colors and Styling:** Use CSS to apply different colors, fonts, and styles to your website. Experiment with different color combinations to create a visually appealing design. Ensure that the colors you choose are readable and do not hinder the usability of the website ([use the Adobe color wheel](https://color.adobe.com/create/color-wheel)).
7. **Bonus:** Add additional features or pages to enhance your portfolio website, such as a blog section, testimonials, or a downloadable resume.

## Submission Guidelines:

Once you have completed your portfolio website, host in on GitHub, and submit the link to your hosted address on Google Classroom.

Please note that this assignment is designed to assess your understanding of HTML, CSS colors, and your ability to create a visually appealing and functional website. Feel free to be creative and add your personal touch to make your portfolio website unique.

Good luck!
